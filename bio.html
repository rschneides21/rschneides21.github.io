<h1>Biography</h1>
<p>My name is Ryan Schneiderman. I was born and rasied in Williston, Vermont, a suburb of Vermont's biggest city Burlington. I grew up with my dad, Jeff, my mom, Dawn,  and my older brother, Jason. Jason, who also went to Tufts and was a comp sci major, graduated last year and now lives in New York City. My biggest passion is sports, specifically soccer. My favorite team is Manchester City of the Premier League and I haven't missed a game (unless I physically could not watch) in 3 years. My dream is to one day spend a year in England and go to a premier league and champions league game at the Etihad stadium. I also love to play basketball (I played varsity in high school), tennis and golf. </p>
